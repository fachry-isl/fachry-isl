## Hi, My Name is Fachry ðŸ‘‹
I loves to learn many things. From Data Science, Data Engineer, Machine Learning, AI and Software Development. Currently deepening my skill for Full Stack Web Development. My curiousity around technology is inspired by problems that I encounter daily. Starting out my carreer as BI developer, I encounter many problems around data quality that inspired me to learn more about Data Engineer. After some time I also broaden my knowledge around Software Development to help enterpreneur digitalize their businesses and broaden my impact.
I believe expanding knowledge will equip me with a better understanding to solve problems using Technology.
